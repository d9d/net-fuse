# net-fuse

A layered fuse-based filesystem that allows multiple client and server mounts at
the same points.  What can you do with this?

- Transparently stream filesystems over a network (why this was built -- the
  rest are actually side-effects)
- Transparently merge folders on a local filesystem
- Create a RAID controller of sorts
- Create an "invisible" hard linked folder
- Mount a web-service as a filesystem (if it implements the necessary grpc
  services)
- I dunno, be creative ;)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g net-fuse
```

To use the server, or to access the node client API, you can also install or
  link it locally:

```bash
npm install net-fuse
```
```bash
npm link net-fuse
```

### Dependencies

Clients require FUSE for OSX or Linux.  Servers have no external dependencies.

#### OSX

You need to install any of the Fuse implementations for OSX. OSXFuse is the one
  that has been used throughout the net-fuse development. Go to
  http://osxfuse.github.com/ and follow the instructions to get it installed.
  Additionally, the FuseJS implementation that net-fuse uses uses `pkg-config`,
  which you need to have installed on your system in order to compile FuseJS. It
  should come by default in your operating system. If not, then use your package
  manager to install it:

```bash
brew install pkg-config
```

or

```bash
sudo port install pkg-config
```

#### Linux

Install libfuse-dev:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev
npm install fusejs
```

## Usage

``net-fuse --help``

### Node.js usage

All node options are identical to the command line options above, just passed as
  an object and with the directories under a `directories` key.  You can use the
  short or long names (if both are defined, the long name is used):

```js
var netFuse = require('net-fuse');
netFuse({
  server      : true,
  p           : 'r'
  directories : ['/local/path:/hosted/path', '/local/path2:/hosted/path2']
});
```

Or if you prefer, you can simply use the same commands as the command-line API:

```js
netFuse('-S -p=r /local/path:/hosted/path /local/path2:/hosted/path2');
```

The JS API returns a promise that (almost always) resolves with no response, or
  rejects with and error likely containing the POSIX error code.  The only
  method, at the moment, that generates data in the response is `status` (and I
    suppose `help`/`version`, but why you'd be calling those from node I have no
    idea ;)).

## Directory Conflict Resolution

Since both the client and server are capable of mounting multiple directories at
  the same mount points, it is possible (if not likely) for conflicts to arise.
  Conflicts are resolved using the following rules:

### Specificity Rules:

Specificity is defined as the number of folders matching the given path.

Example, writing to a file at `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, folders mounted at the
  following points will provide specificity levels:

```
/          # 1
/foo       # 2
/foo/bar   # 3
/foo/other # 0
```

- most   -- Files are relative to the most specific directory that matches.
- any    -- Any directory with a specificity > 0.

### Conflict Rules

Conflicts arise when multiple directories pass the specificity rule.

- first  -- Files are relative to the first directory.
- all    -- Files are relative to every directory.  Fails with first failure
            code from any, or the first mismatch in the case of reads.
- any    -- Files are relative to every directory.  Succeeds with the first
            success code from any.
- quorum -- Writes go to all and succeed when the majority succeed.  Reads
            succeed when the majority of directories must report the same thing,
            otherwise they throw `EFAULT`.

### Operation Rules

Each type of file operation (`read`, `write`, `append`, `create`) can have it's
  own rules defined.  You can optionally define rules for each client op
  (`chmod`, `create`, `getattr`, `mkdir`, `open`, `read`, `readdir`, `readlink`,
  `release`, `rename`, `rmdir`, `statfs`, `unlink`, `write`)

Defaults are:

```
read   : { "specificity": "any",  "conflict": "any" }
write  : { "specificity": "most", "conflict": "any" }
append : { "specificity": "most", "conflict": "any" }
create : { "specificity": "most", "conflict": "any" }
```

### Server vs Client resolution

The server and client both resolve independently, without awareness of how the
  other is configured.

## Server vs Client versioning

The server and client must be on the same _major_ version (e.g. `1.x.x`), though
  a warning will be thrown if the minor version mis-matches (`1.1.x` vs
  `1.2.x`).
